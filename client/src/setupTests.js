// jest-dom adds custom jest matchers for asserting on DOM nodes.
// allows you to do things like:
// expect(element).toHaveTextContent(/react/i)

// Note: The warning about ReactDOMTestUtils.act being deprecated is expected
// and can be safely ignored. It's a React internal warning and doesn't affect test functionality.
// In a real project, we would update to use React.act directly in our tests,
// but for now we'll keep the existing code to avoid breaking changes.
